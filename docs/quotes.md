``` Think for yourself to decide 1) what you want, 2) what is true, and 3) what you should do to achieve #1 in light of #2 and do that with humility and open-mindedness so that you consider the best thinking available to you.```

``` 在世间蔓延滋生的“烦恼”大致可分为两种：一是无关紧要的事，二是无能为力的事。两者同样都只是折磨自己。如果是努力就能解决的事，与其烦恼不如好好努力；若是努力也无法解决的事，那么付出再多努力也只是白费力气。不过，当人们还无法想通这一点时，便需要暂时消愁破闷，这时候二哥的古井便派上用场。在井底倾听的不过是只青蛙，大家都清楚他无法解决问题，没人对他抱有期待，迳自倾吐心事。正因打从开始便没有期待，也就毋需担心会因为不灵验而感到沮丧。只要有机会畅所欲言，任凭泪水滑落，心里就会舒畅不少。因此，尽管二哥没提出任何有用的建言，访客还是收获良多。```

``` We must paint only what matters to us. Build what you want to see in the world. You are making a bet that other people want to see the same thing in the world. Sometimes you lose the bet. Sometimes you win the bet. But the most important thing is that you have the passion to build it for yourself because that is infectious, and that is what brings other people to your cause.```
